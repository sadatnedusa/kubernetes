- To help you prepare for your **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** exam, it’s crucial to have a deep understanding of the following concepts related to **Namespaces**.
- Below, I’ll provide detailed explanations and examples for each of the points you need to practice and focus on for the exam:

---

### **1. Namespace Creation, Deletion, and Management**

Namespaces are used to organize resources in a Kubernetes cluster, and understanding how to create, manage, and delete them is fundamental for the CKA exam.

#### **1.1. Namespace Creation**

Namespaces can be created using either the `kubectl` command or YAML files.

**Using `kubectl` command**:

```bash
kubectl create namespace <namespace-name>
```

Example:

```bash
kubectl create namespace dev
```

**Using a YAML file**:
To define a namespace in a YAML file, create a file like this (`namespace.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: dev
```

Apply the YAML file:

```bash
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
```

**Verify Namespace Creation**:

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

#### **1.2. Namespace Deletion**

You can delete a namespace using the `kubectl delete` command. Be aware that **deleting a namespace** will also delete all resources within it.

```bash
kubectl delete namespace <namespace-name>
```

Example:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace dev
```

**Verify Deletion**:

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

#### **1.3. Managing Resources in a Namespace**

You need to ensure that when creating resources (like pods, services, deployments) they are created within the correct namespace. You can do this by specifying the `-n` or `--namespace` flag when running `kubectl` commands.

For example, to create a pod in the `dev` namespace:

```bash
kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx -n dev
```

To list all pods in the `dev` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n dev
```

### **2. Resource Quotas and Limits**

Resource quotas help ensure fair resource allocation in multi-tenant clusters by limiting the amount of resources (CPU, memory, storage) a namespace can consume. You also have the option to apply resource limits for individual containers.

#### **2.1. Resource Quotas**

A **ResourceQuota** defines the maximum amount of resources (CPU, memory, etc.) that can be used in a particular namespace.

**Example of creating a ResourceQuota**:
First, create a YAML file (`resource-quota.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: my-quota
  namespace: dev
spec:
  hard:
    requests.cpu: "2"
    requests.memory: "4Gi"
    pods: "5"
```

This ResourceQuota ensures that the `dev` namespace:

* Can request a maximum of **2 CPUs**.
* Can request a maximum of **4Gi** of memory.
* Can only have **5 pods** in total.

**Apply the ResourceQuota**:

```bash
kubectl apply -f resource-quota.yaml
```

**Verify ResourceQuota**:

```bash
kubectl get resourcequota -n dev
```

#### **2.2. Resource Limits**

While ResourceQuotas are about limiting the **total resources** available in a namespace, **Resource Limits** are applied at the **container level** (i.e., for individual pods).

You can set resource limits for CPU and memory in your pod or deployment spec:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: "500Mi"
        cpu: "1"
      requests:
        memory: "200Mi"
        cpu: "0.5"
```

Here:

* **Requests** are the amount of CPU/Memory the container will be allocated when it starts.
* **Limits** define the maximum amount the container can consume.

**Apply the Pod with Limits**:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod-with-limits.yaml
```

### **3. Access Control Using RBAC**

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is a method of regulating access to Kubernetes resources based on the roles of users or service accounts.

#### **3.1. Role and RoleBinding**

* **Role**: Defines a set of permissions within a namespace.
* **RoleBinding**: Binds a Role to a user or group of users (or service accounts).

**Example of creating a Role**:
A `Role` that allows read-only access to pods within the `dev` namespace (`role.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: dev
  name: read-only-pod-access
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

Apply the role:

```bash
kubectl apply -f role.yaml
```

**Example of creating a RoleBinding**:
Now bind the `read-only-pod-access` role to a user (`rolebinding.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-only-binding
  namespace: dev
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: "developer-user"
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: read-only-pod-access
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Apply the RoleBinding:

```bash
kubectl apply -f rolebinding.yaml
```

This setup will grant `developer-user` permission to `get` and `list` pods within the `dev` namespace.

#### **3.2. ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding**

* **ClusterRole**: Similar to a `Role`, but grants permissions across the entire cluster, not limited to a specific namespace.
* **ClusterRoleBinding**: Binds a `ClusterRole` to a user or service account.

**Example of creating a ClusterRole**:
A `ClusterRole` that allows reading pods across the entire cluster (`cluster-role.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  kind: ClusterRole
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  metadata:
    name: cluster-read-pods
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

**ClusterRoleBinding**:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: cluster-read-pods-binding
subjects:
  - kind: User
    name: "developer-user"
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-read-pods
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Apply the ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding:

```bash
kubectl apply -f cluster-role.yaml
kubectl apply -f cluster-rolebinding.yaml
```

### **4. Networking Isolation with Network Policies**

Kubernetes **Network Policies** allow you to control the communication between pods in a namespace or across namespaces. They can enforce rules on which pods can talk to each other, restricting or allowing traffic based on labels, IPs, and ports.

#### **4.1. Defining Network Policies**

Network policies require a **network plugin** (e.g., Calico, Weave) to be installed and configured in your cluster. Network policies are applied at the pod level.

**Example of a Network Policy**: Allow only specific pods in the `dev` namespace to communicate with pods in the `prod` namespace.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-dev-to-prod
  namespace: prod
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress:
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              name: dev
```

In this policy:

* Pods in the `prod` namespace will only accept incoming connections from pods in the `dev` namespace.

**Apply the Network Policy**:

```bash
kubectl apply -f network-policy.yaml
```

#### **4.2. Denying All Traffic (Default Deny)**

To deny all traffic by default and only allow specific traffic, you can create a policy that specifies "deny all" and then "allow" specific traffic.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all
  namespace: dev
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
```

This will block all inbound and outbound traffic in the `dev` namespace. You can then add other policies to allow specific traffic.
